            Let me start by saying I was not sure what to expect. I have had
            readings before, but never my chart read. What an awesome and
            intense experience. Nina is extremely gifted and sensitive when
            delivering what she sees . She called out very specific things Iâ€™ve
            experienced and was able to provide explanations as to why they
            happened. Iâ€™m still trying to soak in the time I spent with her. She
            is a sweet and skilled reader. I will be going back to her and
            sharing her info with my friends and clients. Sheâ€™s legit.`,

            review: `
            Nina helped me understand bits and pieces of information about
            myself that I have been confused about for a long time. Itâ€™s crazy
            to think that reading into charts and learning about the stars the
            night we were born can answer so many questions we have within
            ourselves, but itâ€™s true. It felt like a psychic gift to dissect a
            chart and be able to hit different events/challenges in my life that
            I have been dealing with. Overall, I felt pretty lucky and more
            excited for the path that I am on. Thatâ€™s just my chart though, not
            to brag :) You will have to book a session with her to find out your
            path & answer questions about your past.`,

            Sitting with Nina is like the best therapy session youâ€™ve ever had,
            where you uncover important insights about yourself and your place
            in the world. I had such an incredible experience that I asked her
            to read the birth charts for each of my kids and my husband and
            compare all of them together. It was mind blowing, I have never felt
            more seen and came away from the experience with a profound new
            perspective on how to be a better parent for my children and
            partner. I was always interested in astrology before but never
            really understood it and had no idea how deep it can go. Nina did a
            great job explaining every aspect of our charts and relating it who
            we are. I highly recommend doing an astrology reading with her!`,

Book a reading with Nina if you want  explore your inner world and heal whatever is holding you back from finding more love, happiness and creative self expression in your life.  Nina is compassionate, integral and very intuitive and insightful. She'll help you feel more empowered to move forward in life in the way you want!`,
